## History

Tom Roberts worked as a driver for Astra Taxis. Together with his wife Josie Roberts, he founded Always Classic Cars with the aim of providing a gift for weddings and service to brides. Initially, they started with brands like Ford and Jaguar, but in early 1987, they shifted their loyalty to Rolls Royce.

**History:**
- The 1975 Rolls Royce Shadow was the very first addition to the fleet of wedding cars at Always Classic Cars.
- The vehicle was acquired in pieces as it belonged to Tim White, who faced some financial challenges. AGC Finance had the vehicle repossessed and held it to cover some of their expenses, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise.
- Always Classic Cars had an array of contacts in the industry and knew where to locate most of the parts required to bring this vehicle back to life. 
- Dealing with AGC Finance also led to the introduction of one of their longest-serving chauffeurs in the team today, Mr. Aldo Verrocchi.

**Details:**
- Make: Rolls Royce
- Year: 1975
- Model: Shadow
- Nickname: Oxford
- Engine: 6.7 liters, 8-cylinder engine
- Fuel: 95oct grade fuel
