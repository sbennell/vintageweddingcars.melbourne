## History
Despite being one of the most popular ultra-luxury cars of all time, a limited number of Silver Wraiths were manufactured between 1946 and 1959. Finding one that’s for sale can be a challenge. However, because of its popularity, you shouldn’t have any trouble finding a Silver Wraith that is in excellent condition. It was, after all, an automobile that was favored by various heads of state around the world.
