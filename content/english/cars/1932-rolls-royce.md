## History

Tommy, as we call it at ACC, is a 1932 Rolls Royce with Engine No: GYD12 engine N9G. It came off the test in July 1934 and was a Cooper Saloon delivered in London.

In September 1934, it was delivered to Mrs. Hilda M. Kidd (nee McKay, sister of Cecil McKay, owner of GYD 15) in Sunshine Victoria (Sunshine Harvester Co). By 1936, it was registered in Victoria as Vic 58-820. It was later re-bodied as a Martin & King saloon. Mrs. Kidd, who was married to Col. George Stevenson of South Yarra, Melbourne, re-registered it as Vic-278-237 in October 1938.

In 1938, it was owned by Wing Commander B.L. De Melnotte.

In 1950, Vic J.S. Muir of Ringwood became the owner.

In 1954, it was sold to Vic McLaughlin Motors for £750.

In 1962, it was acquired by Charles McI Janes.

In 1975, it was located in Victoria and Gunnedah, NSW.

Later, the vehicle was purchased by the Circus family Ashton and was used to drive clowns around. It also had a large speaker in the front to announce that the circus was in town.

The vehicle was purchased by Always Classic Cars in December 1998 and came from Queensland. It was white and had a big dent in the front passenger guard, caused by one of the elephants.
