## History
The 1959 Bentley/Rolls Royce Silver Cloud II started its life as a Bentley Silver Cloud. Not much is known about its history, except for the fact that it was converted into a Rolls Royce by modifying the grille, badges, and engine head. It featured the new Rolls-Royce–Bentley L-series V8 engine and improved air conditioning made possible by that engine's increased output. Power steering was also standard, and a new dashboard and steering wheel were introduced.

The similarities in design between the two brands may be due to their shared history as luxury car manufacturers.

Always Classic Cars acquired this vehicle in 2012 at an auction by Shannons. Initially, it was destined for use as spare parts. However, upon delivery, the decision was made to add it to the fleet since it was in reasonable condition and there was a need to fill the fleet. It was registered on the 12th of December 2012 (12-12-12) and was given the name "Lucky," saved from the jaws of mechanical destruction. It was groomed and cleaned up for wedding duty and has become well respected in our fleet of wedding cars.
