## History

The 1960 Rolls Royce Silver Cloud II was first delivered to an Australian solicitor, and not much is known about its early history.

**History:**
- This vehicle is very rare as a Long-Wheel-Base (LWB). Rolls Royce produced 2,717 Silver Cloud II cars, but only 258 of them were built to LWB specifications, making "Tootsie" a desirable and rare find among the few on the road today.
- The car was traded in by the daughter of a Jewish family for a Volvo. Matty Belcher, working for Melbourne City Jaguar in Port Melbourne, rang and asked if Always Classic Cars was interested in acquiring it.
- When the car arrived at Always Classic Cars, it needed some loving care as it had tears and marks on the back seat. It was reupholstered and became a sought-after vehicle in the fleet.
- In the year 2000, with increased demand for wedding cars at the turn of the century, ACC was able to add this elegant beauty in its original splendor to the fleet.
