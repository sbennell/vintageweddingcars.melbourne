## History

The Rolls Royce Sedanca DeVille was built in 1935 for Cecil David George Brownlow, Lord Burghley, 6th Marquess of Exeter.

Noted as an English athlete, he won the Olympic Gold Medal for the 400-meter hurdles in 1928, defeating the favorite American runners Frank Cuhel and Morgan Taylor. This event was depicted in the film "Chariots of Fire."

The second owner was an English pilot.

The next owner was Max Wigington, who purchased the Rolls on August 1, 1967. He was associated with Mr. Wigington Inc., dealing in industrial supplies and steel. The car was delivered from England to Normandy Shores, Senaca, South Carolina, and properly licensed and registered under South Carolina Antique Plate Number 770.

The following owner, George Ronald Lovett, purchased the Rolls in 1992 while sailing his yacht on a four-year world tour. Mr. Lovett is from Fingal Bay, NSW, and a member of the Rolls Royce Club.

The Rolls Royce finally became the property of Always Classic Cars in March 2000. In our assessment, it has done very little mileage yet traveled to three continents. The vehicle is now commercially licensed, and we hope it will create a very special memory for you, just like it did in the past.

The 1935 Rolls Royce Sedanca DeVille is the second oldest car in Always Classic Cars' fleet of wedding cars.
