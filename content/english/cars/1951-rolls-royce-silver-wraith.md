## History
The 1951 Rolls Royce Wraith with WHD57 engine W56D came off the test in April 1950. It features a Park Ward saloon body in green (body N119) and was shipped in February 1951 via Kellow-Falkiner to Vere LeR. Stokoe of Olympia Motors, Melbourne, who took possession on May 1, 1951. The car was registered as VIC= UP-000 in April 1951 and exhibited from August to September 1951. It remained in the Stokoe family's possession until July 1997.

Subsequently, it was owned by May Nichols of the ASPRO Family. For a long time, it was abandoned at McDermott's Workshop. David Palmer sold it to the late Tom Roberts, who restored the vehicle to its former glory.

As the late Diana, Princess of Wales, owned and loved her 1951 Rolls Royce Wraith, Always Classic Cars acquired a similar one in 1996 and, in her honor, named it "Lady Di."
